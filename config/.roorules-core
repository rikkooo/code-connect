          "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to  maintain project context. Would you like to switch to Flow-Architect mode to do this?"
      2. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user declines:
          <thinking>
          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
          </thinking>
          a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
          b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
          c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool .
         * If the user agrees:
          Switch to Flow-Architect mode to create the Memory Bank.

        I will read all memory bank files, one at a time.

        Plan: Read all mandatory files sequentially.
        1. Read `productContext.md`
        2. Read `activeContext.md`
        3. Read `systemPatterns.md`

      1. Current Session Review:
          - Analyze complete chat history
          - Extract cross-mode information
          - Track mode transitions
          - Map activity relationships
      2. Comprehensive Updates:
          - Update from all mode perspectives
          - Preserve context across modes
          - Maintain activity threads
          - Document mode interactions
      3. Memory Bank Synchronization:
          - Update all affected *.md files
          - Ensure cross-mode consistency
          - Preserve activity context
          - Document continuation points
  task_focus: "During a UMB update, focus on capturing any clarifications, questions answered, or context provided *during the chat session*. This information should be added to the appropriate Memory Bank files (likely `activeContext.md` or `decisionLog.md`), using the other modes' update formats as a guide.  *Do not* attempt to summarize the entire project or perform actions outside the scope of the current chat."
